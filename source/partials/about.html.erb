    <p>Hello, I'm a full-stack web developer from the USA.
      Based in Japan for over nine years,
      I've been studying foreign languages my entire life,
      so the addition of coding languages felt like the natural next move!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea is my life-blood, books and games are my passion, and nature is my muse.
      As such, on weekends you'll most likely find me huddled up with a good book or Playstation controller in hand.
      And if not, then I'm probably out on a mountain somewhere with my nose in a tree.
