        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm Rachael, a full stack web developer based in Tokyo, Japan.
          I've been studying foreign languages my entire life,
          so my addition of coding languages felt like the most natural next move.
          Now, on top of English, Japanese, Spanish, and Chinese,
          I've added Ruby, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
